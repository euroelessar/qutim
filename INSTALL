Basic Installation
==================

        qutIM uses the qbs (Qt Build Suite)[http://qt-project.org/wiki/QBS] build system.
The simple instructions for building qutIM are these commands:

                        mkdir ../qutim-build
                        qbs build -d ../qutim-build
                        qbs install -d ../qutim-build


Old (CMake-related) info
========================

        Various components of qutIM have other dependencies as well.
If these are not met when the 'cmake' command is run, those components
will not be built. The output of 'cmake' should make it clear what these
dependencies are and how to meet them.

        Arguments can be given to cmake similar to those given to a traditional
configure script, like the install prefix. See 'cmake --help-full' for more
information. For example, 'configure --prefix=/usr/lib' translates to
'cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/lib'.
