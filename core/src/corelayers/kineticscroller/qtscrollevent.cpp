    \brief The QtScrollPrepareEvent class is send in preparation of a scrolling.

    The scroll prepare event is send before scrolling (usually by QtScroller) is started.
    The object receiving this event should set viewportSize, maxContentPos and contentPos.
    It also should accept this event to indicate that scrolling should be started.

    It is not guaranteed that a QtScrollEvent will be send after an acceepted
    QtScrollPrepareEvent, e.g. in a case where the maximum content position is (0,0).

    \brief The QtScrollEvent class is send when scrolling.

    The scroll event is send to indicate that the receiver should be scrolled.

    sources. Using QtScroller::scrollTo is safe however.
